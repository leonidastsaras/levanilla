          <h2>What’s the Difference Between Traditional Soap and Synthetic Detergents?</h2>
          <p>Ordinary soap is made by combining fats or oils with an alkali (such as lye). The fats and oils react with
            the alkali to form crude soap. When made properly, no lye remains in the finished product.
            Most body cleansers on the market are actually synthetic detergent products. These products make suds easily
            in water and don’t form gummy deposits. While some are marketed as “soap,” they don’t meet the regulatory
            definition of true soap1.</p>
          <h2>Regulatory Definition of Soap:</h2>
          <p>To be regulated as “soap,” a product must meet three conditions:
            Composition: It must be mainly composed of “alkali salts of fatty acids” (resulting from combining fats or
            oils with an alkali).
            Cleaning action: Only these “alkali salts of fatty acids” should cause the product’s cleaning action.
            Intended use: It must be labeled and marketed solely for use as soap (not for moisturizing, fragrance, or
            treating skin conditions).</p>
          <h2>Saponification Process:</h2>
          <p>The hydrolysis of fats and oils in the presence of a base (such as lye) is used to make soap. This process
            is
            called saponification.
            Most soaps today are prepared by hydrolyzing triglycerides (often from tallow or coconut oil) using water
            under high pressure and temperature.</p>
          <h2>Soaps vs. Detergents:</h2>
          <p>Soaps are carboxylate salts of fatty acids, while detergents are sulfonate salts with long hydrocarbon
            tails.
          </p>
          <h2>Using Handmade Soap:</h2>
          <p>Each soap recipe is unique. Some soap makers formulate their recipes specifically for face wash, while
            others
            are better suited for body and handwashing.</p>
